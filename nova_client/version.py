"""
Current Cloud Servers version constant plus version pretty-print method.

This functionality is contained in its own module to prevent circular import
problems with ``__init__.py`` (which is loaded by setup.py during 
installation, which in turn needs access to this version information.)

This code was lifted from Fabric (http://fabfile.org) which borrowed it from
Django.

    Return a version string for this package, based on `VERSION`.

    When ``verbose`` is False (the default), `get_version` prints a
    tag-friendly version of the string, e.g. '0.9a2'.

    When ``verbose`` is True, a slightly more human-readable version is
    produced, e.g. '0.9 alpha 2'.

    When ``line_only`` is True, only the major and minor version numbers are
    returned, e.g. '0.9'.

    This code is based off of Django's similar version output algorithm.

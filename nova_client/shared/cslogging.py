"""
Logging functions for unit tests.

Logs are kept in the .../cloudservers/tests/logs directory.

If the cloudservers package is installed into the system Python, you may or 
may not have permission to create files in that location. This is normal and, 
if you're going to be using the test suite, you would be better off installing 
using the:

    python setup.py develop

command.

This just points your Python's library path at the directory into which you've 
checked out or unzipped the Cloud Servers Service. That way, you can write 
your changes, the unit test log files, etc. back to someplace you know you 
have 'write' permission.

Default rotation is 5 i.e. 5 results kept before oldest is overwritten.

There is currently no way to change rotation schedule other than modifying 
this code. This may be addressed in a future version of this API if there's a 
good reason to do so.
